Just setting up my twttr
When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr. 
In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, 
whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

def main():
    vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
    user_input = input("Input: ")
    if user_input:
        for char in user_input:
            for v in vowels:
                if v == char.casefold():
                    user_input = user_input.replace(char, "")
                else:
                    continue
    else:
        print("Invalid input")
