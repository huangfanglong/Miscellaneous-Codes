		<!--4.-->
		<p> <b>Baldur's Gate 3</b> is an isometric, turn-based, non-linear Role-Playing Game that is set in a fantasy universe with dragons and magic. The choices that the player make can have great effects
		on the game as the story progresses dynamically. Not only that, it also allows the player to pick and choose which race and classes to play as which would have their own consequences
		and effects in the game; from the gameplay to races and lore, it is based on a board game called Dungeons and Dragons so the choices are very diverse and in-depth.</p>
		<p> It has been in Early Access on Steam for less than 2 years and is set to release somewhere in 2023, featuring three different major arcs that takes the player through various
		regions and locations in the game.</p></center>
